# 2- EDA of lexical decision time data and spoken/ written frequency of English words

Lexical decision time is an important behavioral measure in language research. In a lexical decision task, a subject is presented with a word (or non-word like “gnuppet”) and asked to judge as quickly as possible whether or not it is a word. How fast they can make a decision reflects something about the cognitive response of the subject to the word in question. This example uses the **rts.csv** data file to explore those lexical decisions related to English words.
